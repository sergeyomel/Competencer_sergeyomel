##Data preprocessing and initial examination via clustering

This is initial data mining sub-project that is based on skills clustering.

The preprocessing is consists of next steps:
1. Lower casing, extra symbols removing
2. Stop words removing
3. Tokenization
4. Stemming (via MyStem by yandex)
5. Lemmatization
6. FastText data vectorization (CBOW and skipgram based)

Next, we use different vectorization methods
1. K-means
2. DBSCAN
